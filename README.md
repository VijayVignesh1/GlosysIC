## Abstract
Over the past decade, the field of Image captioning has witnessed a lot AQ1
of intensive research interests. This paper proposes “GlosysIC Framework: Transformer for Image Captioning with Sequential Attention” to build a novel framework that harnesses the combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to
encode image and transformer to generate sentences. Compared to the existing
image captioning approaches, GlosysIC framework serializes the Multi head attention modules with the image representations. Furthermore, we present GlosysIC
architectural framework encompassing multiple CNN architectures and attention
based transformer for generating effective descriptions of images. The proposed
system was exhaustively trained on the benchmark MSCOCO image captioning
dataset using RTX 2060 GPU and V100 GPU from Google Cloud Platform in terms
of PyTorch Deep Learning library. Experimental results illustrate that GlosysIC
significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models.
